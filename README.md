# Qubes OS customization

Portable Qubes OS 4.3 desktop customization, managed with Salt from dom0.

## Tiling window manager

The first formula installs Qubes' patched i3 session and its Qubes-specific
settings. It deliberately keeps Xfce installed as a fallback.

The formula:

- refuses to run outside Qubes 4.3 dom0;
- installs `i3` and `i3-settings-qubes` from signed repositories;
- automatically uses direct DNF when dom0 has a direct IPv4 default route;
- otherwise uses Qubes' native Salt package provider and UpdateVM path;
- manages a deterministic user config without running `i3-config-wizard`;
- uses the Super key (`Mod4`) as the i3 modifier;
- makes i3 the default for the next LightDM login without restarting the
  active graphical session;
- leaves the Xfce session and all Xfce packages intact.

### Install the formula

From this repository in dom0:

```sh
./scripts/sync-salt-formula.sh
```

Render and dry-run it before applying:

```sh
sudo qubesctl state.show_sls qubes_gui.i3 saltenv=user
sudo qubesctl state.sls qubes_gui.i3 saltenv=user test=True
```

Apply it:

```sh
sudo qubesctl state.sls qubes_gui.i3 saltenv=user
```

Run the same apply command again to verify idempotence. It should report zero
changes.

Log out only after the state succeeds. LightDM should select i3 by default;
Xfce remains available from the session chooser.

Useful initial bindings:

- `Super+Enter`: terminal in the focused qube
- `Super+d`: application launcher
- `Super+Shift+d`: Qubes application menu
- `Super+Shift+e`: exit i3 and return to LightDM

### Roll back to Xfce

The rollback state changes only the next LightDM default. It does not remove
i3 or delete user configuration:

```sh
sudo qubesctl state.sls qubes_gui.i3.rollback saltenv=user
```

Then log out and select Xfce if LightDM has remembered another per-user choice.

### Configuration

Defaults are defined in `salt/qubes_gui/i3/init.sls`. The supported pillar
keys are shown in `salt/pillar.example.sls`. The package transport defaults to
`auto`; use a pillar override only when route-based detection is inappropriate.

The images under `style_guide/` are visual references for later layout work.
